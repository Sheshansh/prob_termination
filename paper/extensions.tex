\section{Bounds on Expected Termination Time}

As shown in Example~\ref{ex:infinite-time}, already LinLexRSM maps are capable of proving almost-sure termination of programs whose expected termination time is infinite. However, it is often desirable to obtain bounds on expected runtime of a program. In this section, we present a LexRSM-based proof rule for obtaining bounds on expected runtime, and we show how to automatize the usage of this proof rule to obtain polynomial bounds on expected runtime in a subclass of \PP{}s.
