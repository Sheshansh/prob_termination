	ranking functions introduced by Bradley, Manna and Sipma in a seminal CAV 
	2005 paper, and establish for the first time the complexity of some 
	problems involving the inference of such functions for linear-constraint 
	loops (without precondition). We show that finding such a function, if one 
	exists, can be done in polynomial time in a way which is sound and complete 
	when the variables range over the rationals (or reals). We show that when 
	variables range over the integers, the problem is harder---deciding the 
	existence of a ranking function is coNP-complete. Next, we study the 
	problem of minimizing the number of components in the ranking function 
	(a.k.a. the dimension). This number is interesting in contexts like 
	computing iteration bounds and loop parallelization. Surprisingly, and 
	unlike the situation for some other classes of lexicographic ranking 
	functions, we find that even deciding whether a two-component ranking 
	function exists is harder than the unrestricted problem: NP-complete over 
	the rationals 
	and                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}varSigma

	abstract="We propose an abstract interpretation algorithm for proving that 
	a program terminates on all inputs. The algorithm uses a novel abstract 
	domain which uses ranking relations to conservatively represent relations 
	between intermediate program states. One of the attractive aspects of the 
	algorithm is that it abstracts information that is usually not important 
	for proving termination such as program invariants and yet it distinguishes 
	between different reasons for termination which are not usually maintained 
	in existing abstract domains. We have implemented a prototype of the 
	algorithm and shown that in practice it is fast and precise.",
