Emphasis is on modelling rather than abstraction and there are new sections on sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo, renewal-reward, queueing networks, stochastic calculus, and option pricing in the Black-Scholes model for financial markets. In addition, there are almost 400 exercises and problems relevant to the material. Solutions can be found in One Thousand Exercises in Probability.},

  abstract = {We propose timed (finite) automata to model the behavior of real-time systems over time. Our definition provides a simple, and yet powerful, way to annotate state-transition graphs with timing constraints using finitely many real-valued clocks. A timed automaton accepts timed words--infinite sequences in which a real-valued time of occurrence is associated with each symbol. We study timed automata from the perspective of formal language theory: we consider closure properties, decision problems, and subclasses. We consider both nondeterministic and deterministic transition structures, and both B{\"u}chi and Muller acceptance conditions. We show that nondeterministic timed automata are closed under union and intersection, but not under complementation, whereas deterministic timed Muller automata are closed under all Boolean operations. The main construction of the paper is an (PSPACE) algorithm for checking the emptiness of the language of a (nondeterministic) timed automaton. We also prove that the universality problem and the language inclusion problem are solvable only for the deterministic automata: both problems are undecidable ($\Pi$11-hard) in the nondeterministic case and PSPACE-complete in the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss the application of this theory to automatic verification of real-time requirements of finite-state systems.},

  abstract      = {Energy parity games are infinite two-player turn-based games played on weighted graphs. The objective of the game combines a (qualitative) parity condition with the (quantitative) requirement that the sum of the weights (i.e., the level of energy in the game) must remain positive. Beside their own interest in the design and synthesis of resource-constrained omega-regular specifications, energy parity games provide one of the simplest model of games with combined qualitative and quantitative objectives. Our main results are as follows: (a) exponential memory is sufficient and may be necessary for winning strategies in energy parity games; (b) the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games can be solved in NP ??? coNP; and (c) we give an algorithm to solve energy parity by reduction to energy games. We also show that the problem of deciding the winner in energy parity games is logspace-equivalent to the problem of deciding the winner in mean-payoff parity games, which can thus be solved in NP ??? coNP. As a consequence we also obtain a conceptually simple algorithm to solve mean-payoff parity games. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {We consider concurrent two-player games with reachability objectives. In such games, at each round, player 1 and player 2 independently and simultaneously choose moves, and the two choices determine the next state of the game. The objective of player 1 is to reach a set of target states; the objective of player 2 is to prevent this. These are zero-sum games, and the reachability objective is one of the most basic objectives: determining the set of states from which player 1 can win the game is a fundamental problem in control theory and system verification. There are three types of winning states, according to the degree of certainty with which player 1 can reach the target. From type-1 states, player 1 has a deterministic strategy to always reach the target. From type-2 states, player 1 has a randomized strategy to reach the target with probability 1. From type-3 states, player 1 has for every real $\epsilon$>0 a randomized strategy to reach the target with probability greater than 1−$\epsilon$. We show that for finite state spaces, all three sets of winning states can be computed in polynomial time: type-1 states in linear time, and type-2 and type-3 states in quadratic time. The algorithms to compute the three sets of winning states also enable the construction of the winning and spoiling strategies.},

When games are used to model reactive systems with both fairness assumptions and quantitative (e.g., resource) constraints, then the corresponding objective combines both a qualitative and a quantitative component. In a general case of interest, the qualitative component is a parity condition and the quantitative component is a mean-payoff reward. We study and solve such mean-payoff parity games. We also prove some interesting facts about mean-payoff parity games which distinguish them both from mean-payoff and from parity games. In particular, we show that optimal strategies exist in mean-payoff parity games, but they may require infinite memory.},

We introduce direct Rabin and Streett ranking that are a sound and complete way to characterize the winning sets in the respective games. By computing directly and explicitly the ranking we can solve such games in time O(mnk+1kk!) and space O(nk) for Rabin and O(nkk!) for Streett where n is the number of states, m the number of transitions, and k the number of pairs in the winning condition. In order to prove completeness of the ranking method we give a recursive fixpoint characterization of the winning regions in these games. We then show that by keeping intermediate values during the fixpoint evaluation, we can solve such games symbolically in time O(nk+1k!) and space O(nk+1k!). These results improve on the current bounds of O(mn2kk!) time in the case of direct (symbolic) solution or O(m(nk2k!)k) in the case of reduction to parity games},

Formal languages allow for compact, unambiguous representations and yield designs that are correct by construction. The idea of automatic synthesis from specifications is old, but used to be completely impractical. Recently, great strides towards efficient synthesis from specifications have been made. In this paper we extend these recent methods to generate compact circuits and we show their practicality by synthesizing a generalized buffer and an arbiter for ARM's AMBA AHB bus from specifications given in PSL. These are the first industrial examples that have been synthesized automatically from their specifications. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {An open system is a system whose behavior is jointly determined by its internal structure, and by the input it receives from the environment. To solve control and verification problems, open systems have often been modeled as games between the system and the environment; we argue that the game view of open systems should be extended also to the definitions of system refinement and composition. We give a symmetrical interpretation to games between system and environment: the moves of the system represent the outputs that the system can generate (the output guarantees), and symmetrically, the moves of the environment represent the inputs that the system can accept (the input assumptions). We argue in favor of defining refinement of open systems in terms of alternating simulation, which is the relation between games that plays the same role of simulation between transition systems. Alternating simulation captures the principle that a component refines another if it has weaker input assumptions, and stronger output guarantees. Furthermore, we argue in favor of a notion of composition that accounts for the compatibility between input assumptions and output guarantees, and that enables the synthesis of new input guarantees for the composed system. These game-theoretical notions of refinement and compatibility are related to the type-theoretical notions of subtyping and type compatibility, and give rise to an expressive modeling framework for component-based design and verification.},

On the basis of information, these games can be classified as follows: (a) partial- observation (both players have partial view of the game); (b) one-sided partial-observation (one player has partial-observation and the other player has complete-observation); and (c) complete-observation (both players have complete view of the game). The one-sided partial-observation games have two important subclasses: the one-player games, known as partial-observationMarkov decision processes (POMDPs), and the blind one-player games, known as probabilistic automata. On the basis of randomization, (a) the players may not be allowed to use randomization (pure strategies), or (b) they may choose a probability distribution over actions but the actual random choice is external and not visible to the player (actions invisible), or (c) they may use full randomization. Finally, various classes of games are obtained by restricting the parity objective to a reachability, safety, B{\"u}chi, or coB{\"u}chi condition.We also consider several winning modes, such as sure-winning (i.e., all outcomes of a strategy have to satisfy the winning condition), almost-surewinning (i.e., winning with probability 1), limit-sure winning (i.e., winning with probability arbitrarily close to 1), and value-threshold winning (i.e., winning with probabil- ity at least $\nu$,where $\nu$ is a given rational).},

  abstract = {We suggest the first strongly subexponential and purely combinatorial algorithm for solving the mean payoff games problem. It is based on iteratively improving the longest shortest distances to a sink in a possibly cyclic directed graph. We identify a new ``controlled'' version of the shortest paths problem. By selecting exactly one outgoing edge in each of the controlled vertices we want to make the shortest distances from all vertices to the unique sink as long as possible. The decision version of the problem (whether the shortest distance from a given vertex can be made bigger than a given bound?) belongs to the complexity class NP∩CONP. Mean payoff games are easily reducible to this problem. We suggest an algorithm for computing longest shortest paths. Player MAX selects a strategy (one edge from each controlled vertex) and player MIN responds by evaluating shortest paths to the sink in the remaining graph. Then MAX locally changes choices in controlled vertices looking at attractive switches that seem to increase shortest paths lengths (under the current evaluation). We show that this is a monotonic strategy improvement, and every locally optimal strategy is globally optimal. This allows us to construct a randomized algorithm of complexity min(poly·W,2O(nlogn)), which is simultaneously pseudopolynomial (W is the maximal absolute edge weight) and subexponential in the number of vertices n. All previous algorithms for mean payoff games were either exponential or pseudopolynomial (which is purely exponential for exponentially large edge weights).},

In spite of the theoretical double exponential lower bound for the general case, we show that for many expressive specifications of hardware designs the problem can be solved in time N3, where N is the size of the state space of the design. We describe the context of the problem, as part of the Prosyd European Project which aims to provide a property-based development flow for hardware designs. Within this project, synthesis plays an important role, first in order to check whether a given specification is realizable, and then for synthesizing part of the developed system. The class of formulas considered is that of Generalized Reactivity(1) (generalized Streett(1)) formulas, i.e., formulas of the form: where each pi, qi is a boolean combination of atomic propositions. We also consider the more general case in which each pi, qi is an arbitrary past formula over atomic propositions. For this class of formulas, we present an N3-time algorithm which checks whether such a formula is realizable, i.e., there exists a circuit which satisfies the formula under any set of inputs provided by the environment. In the case that the specification is realizable, the algorithm proceeds to construct an automaton which represents one of the possible implementing circuits. The automaton is computed and presented symbolically.},

The formalism permits an algorithmic check if two or more components, when put together, exceed the available resources. Moreover, the formalism can be used to compute the quantity of resources necessary for satisfying the requirements of a collection of components. The formalism can be instantiated in several ways. For example, several components may draw power from the same source. Then, the formalism supports compatibility checks such as: can two components, when put together, achieve their tasks without ever exceeding the available amount of peak power? or, can they achieve their tasks by using no more than the initially available amount of energy (i.e., power accumulated over time)? The corresponding quantitative questions that our algorithms answer are the following: what is the amount of peak power needed for two components to be put together? what is the corresponding amount of initial energy? To solve these questions, we model interfaces with resource requirements as games with quantitative objectives. The games are played on state spaces where each state is labeled by a number (representing, e.g., power consumption), and a play produces an infinite path of labels. The objective may be, for example, to minimize the largest label that occurs during a play. We illustrate our approach by modeling compatibility questions for the components of robot control software, and of wireless sensor networks.},

  abstract  = {Current theoretical solutions to the classical Church's synthesis problem are focused on synthesizing transition systems and not programs. Programs are compact and often the true aim in many synthesis problems, while the transition systems that correspond to them are often large and not very useful as synthesized artefacts. Consequently, current practical techniques first synthesize a transition system, and then extract a more compact representation from it. We reformulate the synthesis of reactive systems directly in terms of program synthesis, and develop a theory to show that the problem of synthesizing programs over a fixed set of Boolean variables in a simple imperative programming language is decidable for regular $\omega$-specifications. We also present results for synthesizing programs with recursion against both regular specifications as well as visibly-pushdown language specifications. Finally, we show applications to program repair, and conclude with open problems in synthesizing distributed programs. © P. Madhusudan.},

  abstract = {We study time-bounded reachability in continuous-time Markov decision processes (CTMDPs) and games (CTGs) for time-abstract scheduler classes. Reachability problems play a paramount r{\^o}le in probabilistic model checking. Consequently, their analysis has been studied intensively, and approximation techniques are well understood. From a mathematical point of view, however, the question of approximation is secondary compared to the fundamental question whether or not optimal control exists. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of optimal schedulers for the time-abstract scheduler classes for CTMDPs. For CTGs, we distinguish two cases: the simple case where both players face the same restriction to use time-abstract strategies (symmetric CTGs) and the case where one player is a completely informed adversary (asymmetric CTGs). While for the former case optimal strategies exist, we prove that for asymmetric CTGs there is not necessarily a scheduler that attains the optimum. It turns out that for CTMDPs and symmetric CTGs optimal time-abstract schedulers have an amazingly simple structure: they converge to a memoryless scheduling policy after a finite number of steps. This allows us to compute time-abstract strategies with finite memory.},

  abstract      = {A method for approximate model checking of stochastic hybrid systems with provable approximation guarantees is proposed. We focus on the probabilistic invariance problem for discrete time stochastic hybrid systems and propose a two-step scheme. The stochastic hybrid system is first approximated by a finite state Markov chain. The approximating chain is then model checked for probabilistic invariance. Under certain regularity conditions on the transition and reset kernels governing the dynamics of the stochastic hybrid system, the invariance probability computed using the approximating Markov chain is shown to converge to the invariance probability of the original stochastic hybrid system, as the grid used in the approximation gets finer. A bound on the convergence rate is also provided. The performance of the two-step approximate model checking procedure is assessed on a case study of a multi-room heating system.},
