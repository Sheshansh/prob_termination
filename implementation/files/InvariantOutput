 Configuration of Aspic * (version 3.4) 
   * name of file : files/aspic.fast 
   * inputfile of type (real) Fast format 
   * DEBUG : Only prints analysis steps in a separate .log file 
   * PRINTING STUFF : Invars(stdout) 
   * ANALYSIS 
    * with acceleration 
   * delay of widening = 1 
   * steps of descending sequence = 0 
   * newpath heuristic = disabled 
   * Name of model = main, Name of file = files/aspic.fast 
   * 2 variable(s) and 9 locs(s) and 11 transitions(s) in the .fst
   * Searching objective in fast strategy 
       -> we suppose that we want to compute post*(init) with init a convex set
       or post*(init) and bad if the state bad exists and bad is convex
       -> Initial region "init" found
       -> Finding initial polyhedron. OK. 
       -> No bad region
   * The initial state has label state_2 and the associated polyhedron is {
$>=0,1>0} 
   * There is/are 0 bad node(s)
   * Printing option = Invars(stdout) 
   * Parsing OK, now analysing 
   * LRA with acceleration with delay =  1 

*** Results : 
   *  Invariants =  
state_2 -----> {true} 

state_3 -----> {false} 

state_4 -----> {false} 

state_1 -----> {false} 

state_5 -----> {false} 

state_6 -----> {false} 

state_7 -----> {false} 

state_8 -----> {false} 

state_9 -----> {false} 
   * Remember that we have no bad region 
   * No accel has been applied
   * Stats =  { time=0.000000; iterations=1; descendings=0; }
